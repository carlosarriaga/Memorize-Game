## Course Content per Class

### Lecture 1: Getting started with SwiftUI

Introduction to the course.  The basics of SwiftUI.  Start working on the first application of the quarter, a card-matching game called Memorize.  This will be the foundation for the first few weeks of course material.

### Lecture 2: Learning more about SwiftUI

The very important concept of Views takes center stage as basic composition mechanisms of SwiftUI (stacking and gridding) are used to put multiple cards into the game, each built out of a reusable “card” View.  A simple demonstration of handling a tap gesture gets the cards flipping over and a couple of buttons are added to the user-interface to control the number of cards in the game.

### Lecture 3: Learning more about SwiftUI

SwiftUI iOS app development necessitates the MVVM architecture. This lecture introduces and showcases MVVM in the Memorize app. All SwiftUI development is done in Swift, a language uniquely supportive of modern programming paradigms. The lecture covers Swift's type system basics, including structs, classes, generics, and functions as types. The Memorize app then advances to implement Model and ViewModel, utilizing generics and functions as types throughout.
